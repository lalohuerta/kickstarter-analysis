### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

	Chart "Outcome based on goal" is not the same as the online class/challenge. Had to check with online session.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
	
	* The months with more successful Theater Outcomes are May, June & July.
	* Is better not to Launch Theater plays by the last quarter of the year. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

	* The more you invest on a Theater play the more probable of successful percentage you have.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

	* Information 4 years old could be not accurate enough for actual projects. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

	* In fact, a lot of information can be obtained from this database depending on the purpose of each project. In my case, I decided to analyze which film/video genre has the most failures in the US, creating a pie pivot chart.
