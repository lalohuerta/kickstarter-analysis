* The top three Months to start a campaign based on the information are:

* May
* Jun 
* July

Final analysis: Some conclusions say that the three countries which you may invest in creating campaigns for theater plays between May and July are:

1. USA
2. Great Britain 
3. Canada

# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

Perform data analysis based on launch dates and funding goals for all the plays. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

To complete this analysis you must follow the next steps:

- First you need to (Year) by Data created conversion

- Second you have to add a pivotTable in Insert tab. Filtered by Parent category & Years, in Columns you need to see Outcomes, Rows with Data created conversion and Values with the count of outcomes. You want to see this information by month

Finally you need to create a PivotChart to visualize the relation between Outcomes & Date created conversion (Months), to do this add a PivotChart in PivotTable Analize tab, select line chart in the design Tab by clicking Change Chart Type. Add a title for the chart "Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date"

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

To complete this analysis you must follow the next steps:

First you need to create a new sheet and label it "Outcomes Based on Goals.", create the following columns to hold the data:
- Goal
- Number Successful
- Number Failed
- Number Canceled
- Total Projects
- Percentage Successful
- Percentage Failed
- Percentage Canceled

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Chart "Outcome based on goal" is not the same as the online challenge. Had a jumpstart session on Thursday but appearently was not my session, 	meanwhile I will let the chart as it appeared, on Friday I will have a tutoring session and I will ask there. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
	
	* The months with more successful Theater Outcomes are May, June & July.
	* Is better not to Launch Theater plays by the last quarter of the year. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

	* The more you invest on a Theater play the more probable of successful percentage you have.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

	* Information 4 years old could be not accurate enough for actual projects. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

	* In fact, a lot of information can be obtained from this database depending on the purpose of each project. In my case, I decided to analyze which film/video genre has the most failures in the US, creating a pie pivot chart.
